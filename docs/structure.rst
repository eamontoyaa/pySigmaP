Structure
=========

**pySigmaP** is written under the object-oriented paradigm and divided into six modules. One of them contains the class to load and manage the data of the compressibility curve, and the other five contain the classes to determine the preconsolidation pressure via nine different methods.

Each module is documented and basic examples are illustrated.
